It has two aims:

1. help them promote their school's model formula one racer
2. help them practice for the competition (e.g. to have a good response time)

The app itself is a played as follows:

- Beginners' mode: you need to observe the red lights, and touch the screen as fast as you can after they all go off.
- Advanced mode: in addition to the beginners' mode, you also need to keep track of the balance of your car by keeping a balance bubble in the target

The game is integrated with Google Play's game services and the best players are listed in the leaderboard there.
